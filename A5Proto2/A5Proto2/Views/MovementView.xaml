            You control the character with the green circle around his feet, and move him around the office environment by touching/clicking where 
            you want him to go. Likewise clicking on a object will start an interaction, and clicking on a person will move your character to the 
            other person and start a conversation.
            For the demo clicking anywhere on this screen will bring you to an example conversation screen, as this is the focus of the demo.</TextBox>
